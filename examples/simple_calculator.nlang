let x be 10.
let y be 5.
define sum as x plus y.
define difference as x minus y.
define product as x times y.
define quotient as x divided by y.

print "x = " plus x.
print "y = " plus y.
print "sum = " plus sum.
print "difference = " plus difference.
print "product = " plus product.
print "quotient = " plus quotient.

if x is 10, print "x equals 10".
if y is less than x, print "y is less than x".
