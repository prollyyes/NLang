# Machine Learning Workflow Example in NLang
# This demonstrates the vision for AI-optimized programming

# Load and prepare data
import pandas.
import sklearn.

let dataset be "iris.csv".
define train_size as 0.8.
define test_size as 0.2.

# Define model parameters
let n_trees be 100.
let max_depth be 5.
define learning_rate as 0.01.

# Training workflow
print "Loading dataset from " plus dataset.
print "Training with " plus n_trees plus " trees".
print "Maximum depth is " plus max_depth.

# Evaluation logic
let target_accuracy be 0.95.
if accuracy is at least target_accuracy, print "Success! Model meets target accuracy".
if accuracy is less than target_accuracy, print "Need to improve model performance".

# This would transpile to scikit-learn code like:
# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# import pandas as pd
# 
# data = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)
# 
# model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
# 
# if accuracy >= 0.95:
#     print("Success! Model meets target accuracy")
# else:
#     print("Need to improve model performance")
